## ZeroTips v0.1 help ##

ZeroTips is a zero-knowledge tipping bot for reddit. Sourcecode is available [here.](https://github.com/Nyancoins/ZeroTips)

## How to use ##

ZeroTips works by only storing your crypto-currency addresses, not the actual coins. If you receive a tip, I'll look in my database and see if I have a fitting address on record - and if not, I'll ask you what to do.
